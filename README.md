# Visual Question Answering Notes
*My notes on Visual Question Answering(VQA) papers*

**Visual Question Answering**: a task in which a model is provided with an image and a question related to the image is asked. Goal here is to answer the question correctly. For example, given a following image and asked a question "What time of the day the picture was clicked?", the VQA model should correctly answer "afternoon".
